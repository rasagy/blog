Making [anything](http://tjrus.com/iphone) & [everything](http://www.alessioatzeni.com/mac-osx-lion-css3/) in CSS3 seems to be the rage these days. So to celebrate the Republic Day of India, I decided to (*finally*) play with CSS3 by making the Flag of India using it. Here’s the result:

And here’s the Indian Flag (SVG) on Wikipedia:

[![Flag of India on WikiMedia](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/41/Flag_of_India.svg/640px-Flag_of_India.svg.png)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_India.svg)

I’ve been wanting to play with CSS3 for quite a while, but always ended up keeping it for later. When I found [lot of country flags made in CSS3](http://stevefitzpatrick.co.uk/demos/flags/) (and surprisingly, no one made one for India), I decided to give it a shot. I’ve used [pseudo elements (:before & :after)](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/07/13/learning-to-use-the-before-and-after-pseudo-elements-in-css/) and css transform for making this.

The code is [available on jsFiddle for you to explore and play around](http://jsfiddle.net/rasagy/ub8Du/). Maybe I’ll tweak it to use nth-child and less classes next. :)

I enjoyed learning while creating this, and would love any feedback (Optimize code? Less number of DIVs?). Drop a comment!

PS: Tested in Chrome 16 (Horizontal Spoke gets pixelated), FF9 (All spokes smooth!) and IE9 (Looks lovely, ironically!). How does it look on your browser?
