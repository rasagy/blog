Last month, right after celebrating _Diwali_ – the festival of lights in India – I got a chance to head to the hills to meet a bunch of crazy artists, geeks & makers. Here's a peak into how HillHacks was from my eyes.

There were two things that caught my attention when I first found out about HillHacks. First was the attempt to bring artists & tech-centered folks _under the same roof_. While I've been meeting folks who are both (& the term **maker** best describes them), most events focus on only one of the two communities (Makerfest might be an exception). Second was the open, _un-conference format_, which I've always been curious to know more about (I have a mixed opinion of Barcamps). It was exciting to see all the discussions happening on the mail group about accommodation, finances, reaching out to schools & locals etc, and this sounded like something I don't want to miss.

###First Impressions

I reached Dharamshala at 6AM, right in time for the sunrise. While walking from the bus stop to the Country Lodge, I saw the sky turn from pitch black to a beautiful gradient of blue & violet, with subtle contours of mountains & valleys visible. Perfect way to start your weekend!

Country Lodge was a cozy-looking place with two lawns (one converted as the main hall), and rooms filled with folks sleeping _everywhere_. Early morning, the rooms felt like dungeons that you must _tip-toe_ to get to the other side. Me & Paulami – who had already reached a couple of days back – chatted till it was time for breakfast.

###Geeks galore

It all felt nice & cozy till I started seeing a few familiar folks at breakfast, and realized that the crowd was mostly tech-folks. That was slightly disappointing, since I would generally find a similar crowd in events at Bangalore, and was hoping to meet more artists here (ideally with an interest in using technology in their work). While the folks here were much more serious contributors to various projects than your average conference goer, this made me hesistant in talking to new people (which I regretted later on).

###Stretch-y start to the day

The first session, however, uplifted my mood. [Tink]() took a session on _Stretching for Geeks_, which was not only fun – thanks to her chirpy attitude – but was also something I wanted to learn for quite some time. From finding excuses to take short _standing_ breaks to excercises you can do _in a loo_, it was a fun and enlightening session. In fact, I guess several folks asked her to put this up online (I surely requested her to!), and you should head here for her upcoming videos!

###Keynote on Open Source

[Kiran](https://twitter.com/jackerhack) gave the keynote of the day, which was more of a myth-buster about various Open Source movements (OSS/FOSS/FLOSS). The most interesting part was around the economics of Open Source, and an interesting metaphor of goods & platforms to explain this in detail.
