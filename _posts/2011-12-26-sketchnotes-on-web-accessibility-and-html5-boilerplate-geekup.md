In October, I had attended a [Geekup](http://geekup.in/) session on Web Accessibility & HTML5 Boilerplate. This was a first in a series of sessions being conducted by [HasGeek](http://hasgeek.com/) in Bangalore. Here are the 2 Sketchnotes I made.

Before the main talk, [Rahul Gonsalves](https://twitter.com/gonsalves_r) talked about following web standards to ensure your website is accessible for everyone â€“ including people with specific inabilities. His talk included some general guidelines as well as some specific code tips.

This was followed by [Divya](https://twitter.com/divya) (Web Opener at Opera) introducing different features of [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/). It comes with fixes to common web development problems and has basic code ready to use. If you like the idea, do give it a shot.

These were my first sketchnotes at a conference. I was lucky to have these [sketchnotes featured](http://sketchnotearmy.com/blog/2011/11/15/hasgeek-geekup-sketchnotes-rahul-gonsalves.html) by [SketchnoteArmy](https://twitter.com/SketchnoteArmy). Feel free to give any feedback! :)
