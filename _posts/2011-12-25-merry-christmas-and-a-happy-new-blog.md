What better time to start a new blog, than NOW? Finally, I have one place to archive my thoughts, ideas & sketchnotes.

It’s been quite a while since I stopped blogging – due to lack of time/ideas/just being lazy. I’ve been procrastinating for a very long time about starting a new one. Some of the ideas that came to my head are lost in old notepads, and some lost in my head. I’ve spent the past few months getting used to my new life – new city (Bengaluru), new friends (and some old ones too!), new job – and now it’s time to start working on all those ideas that I really wanted to!

So expect regular posts on design, a  lot of sketchnotes and random ideas that keep coming in my head. 2012 should be fun! :)

PS: [Subscribe to my blog](http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=RSDNotes&loc=en_US) and get an email when I post next! Or if you’re on twitter, follow me ([@rasagy](http://twitter.com/rasagy)) for updates! ;)
