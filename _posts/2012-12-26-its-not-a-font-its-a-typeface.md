One of my favorite ways to bug everyone, is to scream this whenever someone mixes the terms *font* and *typeface*. So much, that I ended up making this quick poster for a friend:

[![Font vs Typeface Poster]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2012/12/Font-Poster-by-Rasagy.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2012/12/Font-Poster-by-Rasagy.png)

Of course, it would be wrong to not explain the difference. The best explanation comes from Norbert Florendo:

> “*Font* is what you use, and *typeface* is what you see.”

Another one, added by Nick Sherman on [this thread](http://typographica.org/features/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2007/), goes:

> “The way I relate the difference between *typeface* and *font* to my students is by comparing them to *songs* and *MP3s*, respectively (or *songs* and *CDs*, if you prefer a physical metaphor).”

As always, there’s [this comment on a Typophile thread](http://www.typophile.com/node/14701#comment-84350) that covers this & many more terms (like type, type family, glyphs etc).

So the next time someone uses these terms incorrectly, you know what to do. (Scream at them, of course!)

Have a great year ahead! :)
