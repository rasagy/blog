Last month I volunteered for organizing [Droidcon India](http://droidcon.in/2011/) at Bangalore – India’s first Android conference. I worked with some amazing guys from [@HasGeek](https://twitter.com/hasgeek) & [@BlrDroid](https://twitter.com/blrdroid), made new friends, and learnt a lot about the Android platform. And I squeezed some time to sketchnote for the session: “Humanize the Android” by [Vivek Juneja](https://twitter.com/vivekjuneja).

I was keen to attend this talk from the starting – thanks to the “[teaser blogposts](http://www.vivekjuneja.in/search/label/droidcon)” by Vivek before the event started. His talk introduced some basic lessons from Cognitive Psychology & Game Theory to help improve the overall User Experience of Android apps (which applies to all mobile apps in general!). Here’re my sketchnotes:

Unlike my [last sketchnotes](http://rasagy.in/blog/2011/12/sketchnotes-on-web-accessibility-and-html5-boilerplate-geekup/) at Geekup event (also by HasGeek), this time I added a few illustrations later (Like the Mario one) and tried to play with a highlighter. More fun! :D
